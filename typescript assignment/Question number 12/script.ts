// question number 12 
// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name. 


let Names: string[] = ["Rafay", "Kashan", "Shayyan"]

for (let i = 0; i < Names.length; i++) {
    console.log(`${Names[i]} is very good person`)
}
