// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
function createCar(manufacturer, model, ...additionalInfo) {
    const car = { manufacturer, model };
    // Adding additional key-value pairs
    additionalInfo.forEach(([key, value]) => {
        car[key] = value;
    });
    return car;
}
// Calling the function with required and additional information
const carInfo = createCar("Toyota", "Camry", ["color", "Blue"], ["year", "2022"]);
// Printing the object
console.log(carInfo);
